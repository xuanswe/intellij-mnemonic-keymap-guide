# intellij-mnemonic-keymap-guide

* Install [Mnemonic Keymap](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/19094-mnemonic-keymap) plugin
* In `Settings > Keymap`
  * Choose Mnemonic Keymap on Windows or Mnemonic Keymap (macOS) on MacOS
  * Duplicate and rename the copied keymap to something like `Mnemonic Keymap Custom` or `Mnemonic Keymap (macOS) Custom`
* Optionally, on MacOS, open `Apple logo > System Settings... > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts... > Modifier Keys`
  and change the Control key to be Command key and vice versa.
  For people who work on both Windows and MacOS, this is convenient.
  For example, Command+C on MacOS is now physically the same as Ctrl+C on Windows.
* Refer to this [doc](https://github.com/dmimat/intellij-mnemonic-keymap) to check the shortcuts
* Depend on each person, continue to customize shortcuts from the base Mnemonic Keymap.
  See below section for my personal recommended customizations.
* Best practices: try to not changing or removing default shortcuts of the Mnemonic Keymap plugin.
  So that less things to worry about when updating the plugin (ex. new shortcuts) or working on a new machine.
